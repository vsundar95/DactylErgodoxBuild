# DactylErgodoxBuild
## Abstract
This build log details how I was able to build the Dactyl Ergodox from OhKeycaps!
Most of the parts came from the DIY Kit from OhKeycaps. The microcontrollers 
came from keebio since OhKeyCaps did not have them. I will also list the github 
repos that contain the necessary files in order to flash the microcontrollers.
Keycaps were also purchased from OhKeyCaps but were individually purchased as
separates. There are bundles for purchase but are seldom available. Overall,
this build was relatively easy once I knew where to wire and how to flash the
controllers. I highly recommend joining the discord for OhKeyCaps for any help.

## Materials
If you do buy the DIY kit from OhKeyCaps, then a majority of the items already
come included for example the diodes, the TRRS jacks, the wrist gels,
and the PCBs. I strongly 
recommend the Amoeba PCBs for this build. The make wiring easy and it looks
clean in my opinion.  

As for the wires, I bought the 30AWG wire from Amazon. Make sure to buy a 30AWG
wire stripper to make stripping wires easy. You are going to need to buy a
solder gun with solder and flux to solder the wires and the dioides to the
PCBs. 

The Microcontrollers are the Elite-C. They allow me to run a USB-C cable to
my computer. 

## Software 
The two main pieces of software for this build are AVRDudess and Vial. These
software do run on Linux, Windows, and MacOS. For this documentation, I will be
writing if the user is using a Linux machine.
